# This is a pre-built wheel of cTDS, which supports accessing MSSQL databases
# using the TDS protocol.  We're using this because we had problems downloading
# large amounts of data over ODBC.  If you're on a platform other than Linux
# then you'll have to install cTDS yourself:
# https://zillow.github.io/ctds/install.html
#
# For more background on this see:

# We still use pyODBC in our tests because we use SQLAlchemy to set up our test
# data and there's currently no SQLAlchemy adapter for cTDS. I managed to get
# one mostly working, but it tripped up on the hyphen separated field names in
# the EMIS backend. Once these have been removed it might be worth trying
# again.
